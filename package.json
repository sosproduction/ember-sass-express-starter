Directory structure is heavily influenced by [ember-tools](https://github.com/rpflorence/ember-tools) and [Ember App Kit](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit). In fact it is designed to work with ember-tools for quickly scaffolding models, views, template, routes and controllers. Here is an example from ember-tools's github page:\n\n![Alt](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-953Nn0wsC_E/UtICtjFhYII/AAAAAAAAD0M/4TzndfztrP4/w1200-h694-no/687474703a2f2f636c2e6c792f696d6167652f32473078333233753135306d2f656d6265722e676966-3.gif)\n\nThanks to Ember's *Convention-over-Configuration* we are quickly able to generate application files with a simple command. That is a huge time saver in the long run.\n\n\n<hr />\n**Versions:** Ember 1.3, Ember Data 1.0b5, Handlebars 1.1.2, jQuery 2.0.3\n<hr />\n\n## Prerequisites\n- Node.js `http://nodejs.org`\n- MongoDB `brew install mongodb`\n- ember-tools: `sudo npm install -g ember-tools`\n\n## Usage\nClick on **Download ZIP** button in the right sidebar.\nExtract and navigate to the directory in terminal. Then to install all the dependencies run:\n```\nnpm install\n```\nTo start a web server, run `node app.js`. **Note**: MongoDB must be running or else the server won't start. Then visit `http://localhost:3000`. There are no server-side views, thus you will not see `res.render` anywhere in the code. The `index.html` is loaded implicitly from the `/public` folder. And `index.html` in turn loads the entire Ember application.\n\nUpdating *.scss stylesheets will automatically result in generating a proper css file, as long as the Express server is running. This ability is provided by the `node-sass` library.\n\nFor Ember source files you will use **ember-tools** to build and watch for file changes. Simply run `ember build` in the project root directory to compile all javascript files into `application.js`. If you want ember-tools to automatically run build command when files change, run `ember build -w`. Simple as that.\n\nTo recap: Make sure MognoDB is running. Run `node app.js`. Then in a separate terminal tab run `ember build -w`. And you are all set.\n\nFor generating models, views, controllers, templates, routes please refer to ember-tools [github page](https://github.com/rpflorence/ember-tools).\n\n## TODO\n- ~~Authentication (Local)~~\n- Improve security of token-based authentication\n- Facebook Oauth2 via ember-simple-auth\n- ~~Express Middleware~~\n- Offline.js plugin for notifying user when they are offline\n- Notification when server is taking too long to respond\n- Youtube-like AJAX loading animation\n- ~~Bootstrap navbar~~\n- QUnit Ember tests\n- Display an alert message on login/singup request timeout\n- Bootstrap Sticky Footer\n- Ember-validations for client validations\n- Express-validator for server validations\n- User OR email sign in (passport-local config)\n- Passport-local vs token-based approach with no sessions\n- Change `people` model to posts to avoid confusion with `user` model\n\n## Tests\nThere are currently no actual Ember tests, but I plan to add QUnit tests in the future. Why QUnit and not Mocha or Jasmine? QUnit is the default testing framework in Ember, and I have no preference for any testing framework, so I chose to stick with the defaults. But of course feel free to swap it for something else.\n\n## Contributing\nPlease feel free to submit a bug, propose an enhancement, send pull requests. This project is definitely not set in stone, and I plan to keep always improving it as I learn better practices from Ember and Node.js communities.\n\n## License\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Sahat Yalkabov\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
